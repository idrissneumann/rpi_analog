# Analog sensors

This project aims to collect the data from analog sensors (ph, electrical conductivity, water temperature and flow) plugged in an Arduino Leonardo and index those data into Elasticsearch hosted on a raspberrypi and make some beautiful dashboards using Kibana hosted too on the raspberrypi.

The elasticstack images used are available [here](https://gitlab.comwork.io/oss/elasticstack/elasticstack-arm) in opensource too.

This project is used by the [veggiepi](https://veggiepi.comwork.io) project.

## Run locally using docker-compose

Pick the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file and follow the steps below.

### Run elasticsearch

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d es01
```

Then wait until it answer on the 9200 port (you can check the logs with `docker logs veggie_es01`):

```shell
$ curl localhost:9200
{
  "name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "v22OI4ILQZ-xfmlArtmHUw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.10.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "747e1cc71def077253878a59143c1f785afa92b9",
    "build_date" : "2021-01-13T00:42:12.435326Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.7.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

### Run Kibana

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d kib01
```

Then wait until the UI of Kibana is loading on http://127.0.0.1:5601 (you can change the ip by your local network ip if you want to load the Kibana UI from another computer and you can check the logs with `docker logs veggie_kib01`).

### Run the service

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d vflow01
```

Then you can check the logs with `docker logs veggie_vanalog01` and check the data on Kibana!
